Right now I am:

## Studying practical deep learning with [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)

I'm revisiting machine learning practice. I studied some data modelling and analysis / ML on my CS Masters. I really like the way the fast.ai course teaches deep learning from practical to theory. They describe it as "play the whole game".

## Rebuilding [Mega Mentor](https://mega-mentor.com)

We launched Mega Mentor in May 2020. We deliberately wanted to take a minimum-viable product approach to initially test the concept. It really paid off. Now have over 100 mentors regularly connecting with mentees and sharing their experience. We are designing a whole new experience for Mega Mentor and rebuilding it as a fully featured web app.
