As you read this story, think about these four questions:

- What is an experience?
- What is an interface?
- Is it possible to create an experience without an interface?
- Is it possible to create an interface without creating some sort of experience?

### Let‘s compare two restaurants

Imagine you are taking your date for a romantic dinner.
You walk through the restaurant doors at the bottom of a large concrete building. The first thing you notice is the grey vinyl floor. The tables are white Formica, surrounded by plastic school-canteen style chairs. Light from bright white halogen bulbs floods the restaurant. The maître d’, dressed in what looks like a white lab coat, greets you and walks you to your table. They hand you tablet computers with the menu to place your order.

```ruby
def main
  @attribute = Foo.bar
end
```

```bash
 cd home
```

You order your meal and it arrives, within 8 minutes precisely, on metal trays. They bring you cutlery over but they are 3x oversized and difficult to use. You end up flicking food over each other. Frustrated and upset you leave the restaurant.
The restaurant across the road looks inviting. It is small and domestic sized. You walk through velvet curtains that keep out the chill. The floor is made of waxed oak. The tables are also wooden, small and intimate. Each table has a collection of soft cushioned chairs. On the tables are candles, the only lighting in the room except for the soft glow of globe wall lights. Tables are pre-set with normal-sized cutlery, giving you relief to know that you won’t leave covering your date in more food. The waiter, wearing a white shirt and bow tie, comes to your table bringing a simple, single-sheet paper menu.

After 20 minutes, your food [arrives on handmade earthenware](#) ceramic plates. The waiter learns that this is a special date for you; an anniversary. They bring you a small carafe of wine, compliments of the house.
What is going on here?
Both restaurants carry out the function of serving you dinner. But, what is it about the second restaurant that signifies “a romantic experience”? What kind of user experience does the first restaurant suggest? Maybe a hospital? Perhaps a prison? A school? A modern office block?
What is the user interface (UI)?
Simply put, the user interface is the physical elements that make up the restaurant. The UI elements in both restaurants do the same thing but it is their material, form and aesthetics that signify what we expect of a romantic experience.
Let’s compare the UI from our two restaurants:

| Restaurant one      | Restaurant two          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Concrete building   | Domestic building       |
| White lab coat      | White shirt and bow tie |
| Metal tray          | Earthenware plate       |
| White Formica table | Wooden table            |
| Plastic chairs      | Cushioned chairs        |
| Halogen lighting    | Candle lighting         |
| Tablet menu         | Paper menu              |

### What is the user experience (UX)?

On this basis, the design of the user experience can not be separated from the design of the user interface. It is the combination and interplay between user interface elements that make up the experience of a romantic dinner.
For example, we can’t simply put a [candle on the tables](#) of the first restaurant to transform it into a romantic restaurant. You can’t redesign the interface without also making design decisions about the experience. User experience and interface design are intimately linked. So if you want to create a ‘romantic experience’, maybe it’s time for a refit.
It is important to say that user experience design isn’t just a sum of parts. As a design practice, it involves understanding and responding to your users’ needs and expectations. Designing experiences also involves thinking about how someone interacts with an interface over time.

### Let’s compare two digital products

Most digital products and services will send you some form of automated email. For example, to reset your password or send you a receipt.
GOV.UK Notify and Sendgrid both send these types of automated email. They have similar features but the design of their user interface and user experience are different. These differences are in part driven by the users and context they are designed for.
We won’t go into detailed comparison here. We will just look at their dashboards. In both products, this is the first view you see after you log in.

### What is the user interface (UI)?

Like our restaurants, the user interface describes all of the on-screen components that make up the product. In both cases, the UI elements of both products do the same thing but their aesthetics differ.
Simple 7-day stats view — Detailed 7-day stats view
No data visualisation — Data visualisation
Simple feature menu — Complex feature menu
Support and documentation in the main menu — Support and documentation in an off-screen menu

## What is the user experience (UX)?

To unpack the user experience, it is important to acknowledge the differences between users of GOV.UK Notify and Sendgrid.
GOV.UK Notify is designed for teams delivering public services in the UK. This often involves collaboration between technical and non-technical users. Sendgrid is designed for startups and enterprises. Its primary users are often developers setting up and monitoring transactional emails in a company’s software.
We might characterise the overall user experience of GOV.UK as simplicity and Sendgrid as mastery. This is because they are designed for different people, who need a different experience. The GOV.UK UI is stripped back and simple. Whereas, Sendgrid’s UI gives its users mastery over the health of their transactional emails.
Lastly, we have only looked at a static snapshot of the product in use here. User experience design involves you thinking about how people use your product or service over time.
